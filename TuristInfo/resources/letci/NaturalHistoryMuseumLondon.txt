Go beneath the waves to explore the extraordinary lives of whales.
Dive through one of the world's most compelling evolutionary journeys in this family exhibition.
More than 100 specimens from the Museum's collection will be on display together for the first time,
 from parts of a colossal blue whale to a small harbour porpoise.
Explore whales, dolphins and porpoises' extraordinary adaptations to their underwater environments,
 and learn how they are similar to us.
Travel back 50 million years to the beginning of the evolution of the whale.
 See how whales became sociable, aquatic mammals,
 some of which can communicate over vast distances.
